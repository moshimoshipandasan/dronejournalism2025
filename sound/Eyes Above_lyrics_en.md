[Verse 1]
They said the sky belonged to kings
Helicopters and expensive things
But now a revolution takes its flight
A thousand dollars buys the eagle's sight
[Verse 2]
Nebraska lab in twenty-eleven
A professor found a piece of heaven
Drought and storms across the plains
One small drone could show the stains
[Chorus]
We are the eyes above
Chasing truth we're dreaming of
Breaking walls that kept us blind
Leaving no one left behind
Eyes above, we rise we soar
Telling stories never told before
[Verse 3]
Thermal glow in midnight air
Laser beams map everywhere
Mudslides measured from the cloud
Silent witness screaming loud
[Verse 4]
Cape Town roads divide the poor
Fishermen break the ocean floor
Only from the sky you see
The shape of inequality
[Chorus]
We are the eyes above
Chasing truth we're dreaming of
Breaking walls that kept us blind
Leaving no one left behind
Eyes above, we rise we soar
Telling stories never told before
[Bridge]
But power comes with weight to bear
A falling blade cuts through the air
Rescue choppers need the space
Know the time and know the place
Privacy is not a game
Can and should are not the same
[Final Chorus]
We are the eyes above
Guided by a higher love
Not the machine but human heart
That's where real journalism starts
Eyes above, we choose to fly
With conscience as our northern sky
[Outro]
Steel and wire, lens and light
Human hands will make it right
The future's watching from the air
Handle it with truth and care
